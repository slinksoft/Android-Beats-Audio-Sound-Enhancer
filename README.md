# Android-Beats-Audio-Sound-Enhancer

NOTE: As of the latest update to Android 10, Google has finally fully deprecated appyling sound enchancements to a global audio source (ID: 0), therefore, this app no longer works. It will work on earlier versions of Android though.

A sound enhancer for Android; revives the old "Beats Audio" mod for non-HTC phones


This app is simply a rebirth of the "Beats Audio" mod for Android; which, back in the day, installed drivers and profiles that were on the OS on HTC phones containing Beats Audio, back when Beats and Monster were together. This app brings that mod back, but with no root required. The app enhances sound and slightly increases bass, which is what the original Beats Audio software did on HTC phones. This was done by applying Audio Effects on the global audio output mix (yes, I am aware session ID "0" is deprecated, but Google never replaced it, can still be used, and is still widely used by equalizer apps on the Play Store today). I wanted to get that Beats Audio feel back, not only for a slightly better Hip-Hop audio experience, but also have that feeling of having such a feature, just like during the Monster/HTC days. This app was made purely for fun.


Features:
- Sound and Bass enhancement
- On and Off switch
- Open Built-in Equalizer
- Run on foreground

Beats Audio has been updated to 1.2. This version fixes a crashing bug when clicking the foreground notification when the user in on the equalizer screen (opened through the app). That being said, you will no longer be able to open your system's built-in equalizer when Beats Audio is enabled; however, you can still open it through your settings, or disable Beats Audio and opening the equalizer through the app (NOTE: you do not need Beats Audio enabled to hear equalizer customizations!).

NOTE: Requires Android 6.0 (Marshmellow) or later to run this app.
